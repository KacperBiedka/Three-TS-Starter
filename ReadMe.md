## Base Three.js, Vite & Typescript boilerplate ðŸŽ´

This boilerplate provides the necessary tsc compilation and base `index.html` file to quickly jump into Three.js development.

## Development

There are a few available commands which help you to build the project. You can spin up the local development server using a yarn's development command.

```bash
# Spins-up a local development server. The preview is visible at localhost:3000.
$ yarn dev
```

In order to generate static files that are production-ready, you need to export the project

```bash
# Compiles typescript files and outputs them in the dist directiory.
$ yarn export
```
